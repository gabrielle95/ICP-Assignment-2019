ICP Chess 2019

Description:

This is a chess game player that can load a basic chess game notation
and allows the user to step it forward. In addition it allows the user
to step in and overwrite some of the steps with the users own moves.
Then, the user is allowed to save such a game. Also the user is allowed
to record a game themselves. User can run multiple games in multiple tabs.
Each game is independent of each other. The save file notation is displayed
in the text browser next to the chess board.

Basic functions:
Open a save file button - loads in a save game
Save a game button - saves the current state of the game in a save file
Undo button - undoes a user-performed step
Redo button - redoes a user-performed step
Forward button - steps the recorded game forward
